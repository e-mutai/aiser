# ML Model Setup

## The ml_model.joblib file is not tracked in git due to its large size (352MB)

### To generate the model locally:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source ml/venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r ml/requirements.txt
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
cd ml/recommender
python train_model.py
```

This will create the `ml_model.joblib` file in the `ml/` directory.

### Model File Location
- **Path**: `ml/ml_model.joblib`
- **Size**: ~352MB
- **Note**: This file is automatically generated and should not be committed to git

### CSV Data Required
The training script expects NSE stock data CSV files:
- `/home/ekm/Desktop/GitHub/NSE_data_all_stocks_2023.csv`
- `/home/ekm/Desktop/GitHub/NSE_data_all_stocks_2024.csv`

Update the paths in `train_model.py` if your data files are located elsewhere.
